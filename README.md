As per instructions, this website was created based on the Wireframe mockup. Many of the effects could have been created using JavaScript, but I followed best practices and used CSS for all the effects seen as it loads alongside HTML and users may have JavaScript disabled.  There is underlying JavaScript that is loaded with Bootstrap elements and Parallax. Thank you for taking your time to review it!
